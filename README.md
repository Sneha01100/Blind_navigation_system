Blind Navigation System - AI Assistive Navigation Model with Real-Time Obstacle Detection
🚀 Overview
The Blind Navigation System is an AI-powered assistive model designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings safely. Using Object Detection, NLP, and Computer Vision, the system detects obstacles in real time and provides voice-based feedback for navigation.

🛠 Features
✅ Real-time Object Detection using YOLOv5 & OpenCV
✅ Speech Recognition & Text-to-Speech for voice-based interaction
✅ GPS & Geolocation-based Navigation
✅ Deep Learning & NLP-powered assistance
✅ Portable & Cost-Effective AI Solution

⚙️ How the Model Works
1️⃣ Capturing the Environment
The system uses a camera to continuously capture the surroundings.
The live video feed is processed in real-time using OpenCV.
2️⃣ Object Detection & Recognition
The captured frames are passed through the YOLOv5 object detection model.
The model detects obstacles (e.g., walls, people, vehicles, poles) and classifies them.
The bounding boxes and labels for detected objects are generated.
3️⃣ Audio Feedback for Navigation
The detected obstacles are converted into a verbal description using NLP & Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3).
The system provides real-time voice alerts to inform the user about obstacles.
If a critical obstacle is detected, the system gives urgent warnings (e.g., "Obstacle ahead, step left").
**4️⃣ GPS-Based Navigation **
If enabled, Geopy fetches the user's location and provides GPS-based navigation.
The system can suggest directions based on predefined locations or waypoints.
5️⃣ User Interaction via Speech Commands
The user can give voice commands using SpeechRecognition.
Commands like "Guide me to the Target Destination".
6️⃣ Continuous Monitoring & Adaptive Responses
The system continuously updates as the user moves.
It dynamically adjusts alerts based on object proximity and movement.
The response time is optimized for real-time usability.
